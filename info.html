            <pre>
Q: Why do all my team members have to be from the same University?
A: This in an intercollegiate challenge we would like it to be clear which College or University won the competition

Q: Why do we need to have a sponsoring department?
A: The winning team will also receive a reward for their department to help fund research and other activities.

Q: I work better alone, is it necessary to have a team of four?
A: Yes, teams must have four members, that way the difficulty and the rewards will be equal for every team.

Q: I have a friend who would like to participate, but isn’t enrolled in any university, can they join my team?
A: Because this is an intercollegiate event, all team members must be enrolled in classes at the same university.

Q: Is the competition all three days, or would each team only compete on one of the days?
A: The competition will take place from 10:00 AM on Thursday to 4:00 PM on Friday. The awards ceremony will take place at 5:00PM on Friday.
team members are welcome to attend openwest regularly on Wednesday and Saturday.

Q: Do we have to be physically present for the entire competition?
A: While some challenges can be remotely, there are several challenges that require local access.
   Being present also makes it easy for our sponsors to interact with your team.

Q: How much time each day would be required?
A: There is currently no time limit. We allow working on the opened challenges 24×7 and it is expected that the competition will occupy the majority of the participant’s time.

Q: Is the competition mostly question/answer or will we actually attempt to break into systems to find a flag?
A: The challenges are typically a combination of Red Team challenges / Scavenger Hunt / QA / physical security.

Q: What day/time is the awards ceremony?
A: It will be on the Friday July 14th at 5:00 PM

Q: Do the competitors need to bring their own laptops?
A: Each participant will need to bring their own laptop with their own tools.

Q: Are competitors allowed to use their own tools (Kali, etc)
A: Yes, absolutely

Q: My team is located relatively far away from Sandy,UT; are there arrangements for staying on/near the premises?
A: Many of the teams based in Utah are planning on carpooling to Sandy every day for the competition; We are working on setting up hotel/food packages for teams that have to travel a significant distance.

Q: Will members of my team be given an openwest badge?
A: The ictf tickets to openwest are greatly subsidized.  The materials you receive at registration will be very different from that of other openwest attendees and will not include an openwest badge.  
Details about registration on Wendesday and Thursday of the event will be sent to the teams.
