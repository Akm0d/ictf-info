            <pre>
Q: Why do all my team members have to be from the same University?
A: This in an intercollegiate challenge we would like it to be clear which College or University won the competition

Q: Why do we need to have a sponsoring department?
A: The winning team will also receive a reward for their department to help fund research and other activities.

Q: I work better alone, is it necessary to have a team of four?
A: Yes, teams must have four members, that way the difficulty and the rewards will be equal for every team.

Q: I have a friend who would like to participate, but isn’t enrolled in any university, can they join my team?
A: Because this is an intercollegiate event, all team members must be enrolled in classes at the same university.

Q: Is the competition all three days, or would each team only compete on one of the days?
A: The competition will take place from 10:00 AM on Thursday to 4:00 PM on Friday. The awards ceremony will take place at 5:00PM on Friday.
team members are welcome to attend openwest regularly on Wednesday and Saturday.

Q: Do we have to be physically present for the entire competition?
A: While some challenges can be remotely, there are several challenges that require local access.
   Being present also makes it easy for our sponsors to interact with your team.

Q: How much time each day would be required?
A: There is currently no time limit. We allow working on the opened challenges 24×7 and it is expected that the competition will occupy the majority of the participant’s time.

Q: Is the competition mostly question/answer or will we actually attempt to break into systems to find a flag?
A: The challenges are typically a combination of Red Team challenges / Scavenger Hunt / QA / physical security.

Q: What day/time is the awards ceremony?
A: It will be on the Friday July 14th at 5:00 PM

Q: Do the competitors need to bring their own laptops?
A: Each participant will need to bring their own laptop with their own tools.

Q: Are competitors allowed to use their own tools (Kali, etc)
A: Yes, absolutely

Q: My team is located relatively far away from Sandy,UT; are there arrangements for staying on/near the premises?
A: Many of the teams based in Utah are planning on carpooling to Sandy every day for the competition; We are working on setting up hotel/food packages for teams that have to travel a significant distance.  Email me at tyler+ictf@utos.org for more information.

Q: Will members of my team be given an openwest badge?
A: ICTF Team captains will be sent 4 codes that can be used to upgrade each team member's ticket to a full openwest ticket for $35.  This upgrade would give them access to the events on Wednesday and Saturday as well as t-shrits, badges, and swag that other attendees receive.
